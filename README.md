Café Website
I created a responsive front-end layout for a café website using Bootstrap and Flexbox. The design utilizes Bootstrap's grid system and utility classes,
 ensuring that the site looks great on various devices and screen sizes.
 The layout showcases the café's offerings, ambiance, and essential information, providing an engaging user experience.
